## Introduction

The Solana Sniper/Trading Bot is a groundbreaking tool in the booming Solana ecosystem, designed to tackle a common issue faced by traders: missing out on profit opportunities after purchasing tokens on the Solana network, leading to token rug-pulls or dumps. This software not only integrates sniping functionality, allowing users to instantly acquire tokens upon their launch but also adds trading tools to optimize oneâ€™s position.
